# GitHub Actions workflows

## ESLint workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-eslint.yaml) is triggered by PRs on the `main` branch. It runs the ESLint.

The workflow:
- Checks out code 
- Invokes `make lint -C testing/e2e/skr`

## Markdown link check workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/markdown-link-check.yaml) checks for broken links in all Markdown files. It is triggered:
- As a periodic check that runs daily at midnight on the main branch in the repository 
- On every pull request that creates new Markdown files or introduces changes to the existing ones

## Release workflow

See [Kyma Environment Broker release pipeline](04-20-release.md) to learn more about the release workflow.

## Label validator workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/label-validator.yaml) is triggered by PRs on the `main` branch. It checks the labels on the PR and requires that the PR has exactly one of the labels listed [here](/.github/release.yml).

## Unit tests workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-unit-tests.yaml) is triggered by PRs on the `main` branch. Then it calls the reusable [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-unit-tests-reusable.yaml).

## KEB chart tests workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-keb-chart-tests.yaml) is triggered by PRs on the `main` branch. Then it calls the reusable [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-keb-chart-tests-reusable.yaml). 

## Reusable workflows

There are reusable workflows created. Anyone with access to a reusable workflow can call it from another workflow.

### KEB chart tests

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-keb-chart-tests-reusable) applies the KEB chart on the k3s cluster. 
You pass the following parameters from the calling workflow:

| Parameter name  | Required | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **last-k3s-versions**  | no  | number of most recent k3s versions to be used for tests, default = `1` |


The workflow:
- checks if the KEB chart is rendered by helm
- fetches the **last-k3s-versions** tag versions of k3s releases 
- prepares the **last-k3s-versions** k3s clusters with the Docker registries using the list of versions from the previous step
- creates required namespaces
- installs required dependencies by the KEB charts
- renders and applies the KEB chart on the k3s cluster
- waits for all tests to finish

### Unit tests

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-unit-tests-reusable.yaml) runs the unit tests.
No parameters are passed from the calling workflow (callee).

The workflow:
- checks out code and sets up the cache
- sets up the Go environment
- invokes `make go-mod-check`
- invokes `make test`
